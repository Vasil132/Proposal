# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Who said it?


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game that presents to you tweets from celebrities and you have to guess who said it.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will randomly pick some tweets said by celebrities and present it to the player. They will then guess who said it and based on if they get it right or wrong, they're score will go up or down. Hopefully if theres enough time to implement this, there will also be a leaderboard that saves the player's score. There will also be a sign in screen that lets you sign into your account if you have created one first. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The game throws out some funny out of context tweets, you guess what celebrity said it and gain points.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Same as above but you can create a profile and log in to save your highscore to be put up on a leaderboard.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Make the game proffesional, for example add a good looking UI, music, etc.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My partner has used ms code before but I have not so I will have to get used to it, also I hope to be able to apply the skills I learned from highscool while coding in JavaScript. I will have to research and learn a little bit on how to make a game. While this isn't your traditional 3d or 2d game that you would think of when someone says game, it still requires some learning on my part to complete this project.
